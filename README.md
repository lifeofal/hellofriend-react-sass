## Project Overview

### What is it?

This is a new version of my portfolio/personal website using the MERN stack (MondoDB, Express, React, Node) with the addition of SCSS for compiling CSS files. I hope to use this site to show off my development skill as well as provide and insight on the teachnologies I have come to learn over the years.

### Tech used

Front End:

For the 'Front End', I decided to learn React.js for its unique way to implement html code and logic in a clean and efficient manner.
Creating my website to be reactive to change was a sellig point for me as I thought it would be better for a recruiter to go through different stages of the site without reloading.

I also decided to learn and use SASS/SCSS extension preprocessor to keep my CSS clean, fast and dynamic. (Sneak a peak at the darkmode features üëÄ)

Back End:

(Status: Unimplemented)

For the 'Back End' I will be using Node.js and Express.js in order to maintain a browserless state. I will hook up my site with MondoDB in order to track comments and testimonials that may be submitted. This side of the project is experimental as there isnt too much of a need to have a NoSQL database for a resume site.

## Updates

### March 22, 2022 üçÄ

First push to the repo. Version control seemed necissary at this point since my last project file was absolutley demolished with a `npm audit --force`. Thankfully I didnt have too many dependencies missing and I could just re-install them through the cache

# REACT readme:
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
